## Project Idea: AI-Powered Study Assistant (Flashcards + Spaced Repetition)

Aideal is a practical and impressive software project that helps students learn faster using AI-generated flashcards and automated spaced repetition scheduling.

### **Core Features**

1. **AI Flashcard Generator**
   - Upload a PDF, textbook chapter, or paste notes.
   - The app extracts key concepts and auto-generates Q&A flashcards using AI (OpenAI's API or open-source LLMs).

2. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**
   - Reviews are scheduled based on your memory retention (rate flashcards: hard/medium/easy).
   - Visual progress dashboard (e.g., "Next review in 3 days").

3. **Quiz Mode**
   - Test yourself with randomized flashcards or fill-in-the-blank questions.

4. **Cross-Platform Sync (Bonus)**
   - Save decks to the cloud (Firebase/Supabase) or export to Anki.

### **Tech Stack Ideas**

- **Frontend:**
  - Web: React/Vue + TailwindCSS
  - Desktop: Tauri (Rust + Web tech) or Electron (JS)

- **Backend (if needed):**
  - Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node.js
  - AI: OpenAI API, Llama 3, or Mistral for local, privacy-focused use

- **Database:** SQLite (local) or Supabase (cloud)

### **Why This Project?**

- **Solves a real problem:** Students waste time making flashcards manually.
- **Showcases AI/ML skills:** Uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract key facts.
- **Scalable:** Add features like voice quizzes or shared decks in the future.

## Alternative Software-Only Ideas

1. **Fake News Detector Chrome Extension**
   - Uses NLP to highlight biased/suspicious claims in news articles.

2. **Automated Resume Tailoring Tool**
   - Input a job description + your resume → AI suggests edits to match keywords.

3. **"Spotify Wrapped" for Books**
   - Scans your Kindle/Goodreads history → generates stats (top genres, reading speed).
